<h1> What is HyperText </h1>
	<p> Hypertext is text which is not constrained to be linear. </p>
	<p> Hypertext is text which contains <a href="links.html"> links </a> to other texts. 
	The term was coined by <a href="tn.html">Ted Nelson </a> around 1965 
	(see <a href="hist2.html"> History</a>). </p>

	<p> HyperMedia is a term used for hypertext which is not constrained to be text: 
	it can include graphics, video and <a href="sound.html"> sound</a> , for example. 
	Apparently Ted Nelson was the first to use this term too. </p>

	<p> Hypertext and HyperMedia are concepts, not products. </p>
